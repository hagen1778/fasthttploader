# fasthttploader (Go 1.7+)

Fasthttploader was created to simplify http benchmarking. Options like QueryPerSecond(QPS) and number of connections are not required anymore. Fasthttploader detects server possibilities by analyzing repsonses and choosing optimal conditions for testing. To avoid adjustment stage (cause it takes some extra time) - just set -q and -c flags.
Fasthttploader generates html-report after testing with some useful charts.

### Quickstart

Docker:
```
docker run --rm -v /tmp:/tmp nickgrealy/fasthttploader -r /tmp/report.html https://www.google.com
```

Install:
```
go get github.com/hagen1778/fasthttploader
```

Run test:
```
fasthttploader http://google.com
```

### Usage
```
Usage: fasthttploader [options...] <url>
Notice: fasthttploader would force agressive burst stages before testing to detect 
max qps and number for clients.
To avoid this you need to set -c and -q parameters.
Options:
  -A string
        Set Accept headers
  -T string
        Set content-type headers (default "text/html")
  -b string
        Set body
  -c int
        Number of supposed clients (default 500)
  -cpuprofile string
        write cpu profile to file
  -d duration
        Cant be less than 20sec (default 30s)
  -debug
        Print debug messages if true
  -disable-compression
        Disables compression if true
  -gatewayAddr string
        Address of PushGateway service (default "localhost:9091")
  -h string
        Set headers
  -httpClientKeepAlivePeriod duration
        Interval for sending keep-alive messageson keepalive connections. 
        Zero disables keep-alive messages (default 5s)
  -httpClientReadBufferSize int
        Per-connection read buffer size for httpclient (default 8192)
  -httpClientRequestTimeout duration
        Maximum time to wait for http response (default 10s)
  -httpClientWriteBufferSize int
        Per-connection write buffer size for httpclient (default 8192)
  -jobName string
        Name of the job for PushGateway (default "pushGateway")
  -k    Disable keepalive if true
  -m string
        Set HTTP method (default "GET")
  -memprofile string
        write memory profile to this file
  -q int
        Request per second limit. Detect automatically, if not setted
  -r string
        Set filename to store final report (default "report.html")
  -successStatusCode int
        Status code on which a successful request would be determined (default 200)
  -t duration
        Request timeout (default 5s)
  -web
        Auto open generated report at browser

```

### Stages
Testing consist of 3 stages:
* Burst - 5sec test with no limits by QPS and number of clients equal (by default, but can be changed by -c passing) to 500. Burst stage helps to detect possible QPS rate for further stages
* Adjustment - 30sec test with smoothly QPS and clients tunning. Initial QPS and number of clients are taken from results of Burst stage. During 30s fasthttploader would increase QPS and number of clients till timeout or getting errors
* Testing - just loading test, based on settings achieved from previous stage.

To rebuild assets use:
```
go-bindata -pkg report -ignore=\\.img -o report/binddata.go report/static/...
```
